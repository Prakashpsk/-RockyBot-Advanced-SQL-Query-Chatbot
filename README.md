## ‚ùì Problem Statement

Business owners and managers often need quick and accurate insights from their databases but may lack the technical knowledge to write SQL queries. RockyBot solves this by allowing users to ask natural language questions and automatically generating the correct SQL queries to fetch the required data.

## üåü Impact of Your Work

RockyBot significantly enhances the efficiency of business operations by providing instant answers to data-related questions. It eliminates the need for technical expertise in SQL, making data-driven decision-making accessible to everyone in the organization.

## üìä Modeling

### Steps

1. **API Key Setup**: Integrate Google Palm LLM with the API key.
    ```python
    from langchain.llms import GooglePalm

    api_key = 'your_api_key_here'
    llm = GooglePalm(google_api_key=api_key, temperature=0.2)
    ```
2. **Database Connection**: Connect to the SQL database.
    ```python
    from langchain.utilities import SQLDatabase
    from langchain_experimental.sql import SQLDatabaseChain

    db_user = "root"
    db_password = "root"
    db_host = "localhost"
    db_name = "atliq_tshirts"

    db = SQLDatabase.from_uri(f"mysql+pymysql://{db_user}:{db_password}@{db_host}/{db_name}", sample_rows_in_table_info=3)
    ```
3. **Query Execution**: Run and test SQL queries.
    ```python
    db_chain = SQLDatabaseChain.from_llm(llm, db, verbose=True)
    qns1 = db_chain("How many t-shirts do we have left for Nike in extra small size and white color?")
    ```
4. **Few-Shot Learning**: Implement few-shot learning for improving query accuracy.
    ```python
    few_shots = [
        {'Question': "How many t-shirts do we have left for Nike in XS size and white color?",
         'SQLQuery': "SELECT sum(stock_quantity) FROM t_shirts WHERE brand = 'Nike' AND color = 'White' AND size = 'XS'",
         'SQLResult': "Result of the SQL query",
         'Answer': qns1}
        # Add more examples
    ]
    ```

## üìà Visualization

Visual representation of data can be added here using tools like matplotlib, seaborn, or Plotly for enhanced insights.

## üèÅ Conclusion

RockyBot revolutionizes how businesses interact with their data, making complex SQL queries accessible through natural language. It ensures that business owners and managers can quickly retrieve and analyze data, leading to better and faster decision-making.

## üí° Recommendations

- **Expand Database Compatibility**: Extend RockyBot to support other types of databases.
